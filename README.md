# lifesciences-framework: A visual and UX framework for the life sciences
Leverage tooling and lessons learned at EMBL-EBI to build better websites and services for the life sciences.

## About

This project is a boilerplate template for projects that would like to leverage the patterns and lessons learned in the [EBI Visual framework](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework/) and need to heavily modify that package's look and feel.

## Getting started

You'll need to use npm to develop with this.

`npm install ebi-framework --save-dev`

### 1. Customise

Edit the `.scss` files in `/scss`

### 2. Build

Run `npm run scss` and your `app.css` file will be generated in `/css`.
